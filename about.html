<h1>About Wayne Moore</h1>

<p class="para">I am a student at Concordia University, NE studying Business Education. I also compete on the shooting sports team. Some of my hobbies include sports (a wide variety), hunting/shooting, watching movies, and just hanging out with friends. My top two sports are football and wrestling as I love watching and competing in them, I love hunting deer, and my favorite movies are thrillers. I am including a picture of what trapshooting (one of many shooting sports events) so you can get an idea of what it loolks like!</p>

<p class="para2"> My favorite hobby is probably shooting sports, and specifcally trapshooting within that. To briefly describe it, there are five stations about 15 yards from where a bunker is. In the bunker is a machine that throws clay targets and these targets are thrown in a 135 degree range. At each of the 5 stations, you shoot at 5 targets and then rotate. You do this until all 5 stations are completed, for a total of 25 targets. Most events will have 4 rounds for a grand total of 100 targets.</p>
